Typescript
------------
build on the top of JAVAscript

backend: java/c#/python/.net/c/c++ (strictly typed languages)

frontend: you required data from backend

code in typescript --> transpile them in js --> run

JS --> as a client side scripting (run a js code then you have to embbed the code in HTML page)

we can also run JS as a server programming

Node JS --> as server side scripting

install node js
-------------------------

check version
>node -v
>npm -v

instal typescript

>npm install typescript -g

check typescript version
>tsc -v

then create typescript file using ts extention 

example first.ts

compile using below command

>tsc first.ts

if compiled successfully then it will create first.js file

to run use below command

>node first.js

_______________________________________________________________________________
install Angular
>npm install -g @angular/cli

after installation check angular version
>ng version

let's create an angular application
> ng new firstapp

(firstapp is the name of my application)

move to the application folder
>cd firstapp

let's run application
>ng serve

Any component
---------------------
four files

ts -- main file of component through which all others file connected.
css- styling
html- template
spec.ts - testing purpose

open ts file and check the annotation @component where you can see the template file and css file.

As this app component is the root component so you can also see 2 more files in that folder.

app.module.ts
------------------
main file, where you can add all your import export and declarations too.

another one is routing file which will help us to create routes.
*********************************************************************

Angular applications are single page application. by default it provides app component as root component.

when we are creating a big application we can't put everything in single component. so we will divide our code in multiple components and then we include them in app component.

to create component use below command

>ng generate component compname (ng g c compname)

create librray
> ng g l mylib

create component under library
>ng g c comp1 --project mylib

How to add bootstrap in Angular application
-------------------------------------------------
there 3 ways to add bootstrap in app

1. open index.html file and include CDN files of bootstrap.

2. install bootstrap by using

	>npm install bootstrap

	> update styles.css file by importing bootstrap css file

              @import '../node_modules/bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css';

3. If you have downloaded the bootstrap files to your local system then those path you can add in your angular.json file.

	"styles": [
              "src/styles.css",
              "./node_modules/bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css"
            ],
            "scripts": ["./node_modules/bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.min.js"]

as this is the main config file. if you chnage this file then you have to execute ng serve command again to load it.
